No-IP Client
No-IP service is providing free subdomains with low time to live (from 10 seconds). I am using DynDNS for a long time. But in last months they made some changes which moved NO-IP to first place. Now in DynDNS you even can not get free hostname, and you have to login to your account on the website once a month or your hostname will be deleted. With No-IP account you can request up to 3 subdomains and to remain your account in active state, running their client is enough. When you go through registration on noip.com site you can go to installation proccess of No-IP updater client. A little caveeat of installation is than No-IP client is not in Raspbian repositories (for now) so we will have to compile it from source code. Firstly download source code from official mirror.
wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
Extract downloaded archive:
tar vzxf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
When archive is extracted, "cd" to new extracted folder (name of folder can be different, because of version):
cd noip-2.1.9-1
Now we can compile by issuing:
make
make install
During "make install" you will be asked for No-IP username, password and update interval (in minutes). After successful compilation you can run the client.
noip2
To start No-IP client at boot, edit crontab:
crontab -e
And add new line:
@reboot sudo -u root noip2
You can close the file (CTRL+X...) and save changes (...press "y" and Enter). Maybe one time you will need to change configuration of No-IP client. In this case stop No-IP client:
killall noip2
And run No-IP client with parameter to ask for new configuration.
noip2 -S
Do not forget to start No-IP client again.
noip2
